    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Aspiring programmer intending to find the ultimate programming 
        related field. Born on the 10th of may in 2008, I discovered that 
        I am extremely interested in programming. I first started coding 
        in my freshmen year of high school and realized the many amazing 
        things programming can do. From simple python projects to self learning
        ai models, with coding, anything is possible.
