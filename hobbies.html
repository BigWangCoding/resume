<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>
    My favorite hobby is coding. I am amazed at the power of coding, spanning from
    creating simples games to solving complex math questions. I spent the majority of 
    my time out of class searching for tutorials, generating ideas, and creating projects out 
    of what I have learned.

    Ever since 7th grade year (5 years of tennis), I have played tennis competitively. I have had 3 different
    coaches teach me strategy, technique, and tennis mindset. I current have a universal
    tennis ranking of 5 and also coach younger kids. I played JV on my freshmen year of high 
    school and played both JV and varsity alternate.

    I played piano since 4th grade. I had 2 piano teachers where I played many pieces
    to win awards. After playing music from all over the centuries, I decided that I enjoyed
    modern pieces the most. Currently I am learning how to play a piece called "cruel
     angel's thesis" from a very popular anime from the 90s.
